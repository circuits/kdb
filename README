kdb is a small plugable IRC Bot framework utilizing the
`circuits <http://bitbucket.org/prologic/circuits/>`)
application framework. kdb was one of the first "test"
applications written in circuits and is still maintained
and kept up-to-date with new features and changes in circuits.

You may use kdb as a framework to build your own projects that
use the IRC protocol. kdb itself comes with a suite of useful
plugins and features. If you'd like to see it in action, feel
free to get in touch with the developer James Mills / prologic
on the FreeNode IRC Network who resides in the #circuits channel.

kdb was created by and is primarily maintained by
`James Mills <http://prologic.shortcircuit.net.au/>`_
