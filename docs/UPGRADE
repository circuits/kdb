Upgrade Instructions
====================

A Trac environment sometimes needs to be upgraded before it can be used with
a new version of Trac. This document describes the steps necessary to upgrade
an environment.

Note that Environment upgrades are not necessary for minor version releases
unless otherwise noted. For example, there's no need to upgrade a Trac
environment created with (or upgraded) 0.8.0 when installing 0.8.4 (or any
other 0.8.x release).

General Instructions
--------------------
Typically, there are four steps involved in upgrading to a newer version of
Trac:

1. Update the Trac Code

Get the new version of Trac, either by downloading an offical release package
or by checking it out from the Subversion repository.

If you have a source distribution, you need to run

   python setup.py install

to install the new version. If you've downloaded the Windows installer, you
execute it, and so on.

In any case, if you're doing a major version upgrade (such as from 0.8 to
0.9), it is highly recommended that you first remove the existing Trac code.
To do this, you need to delete the `trac` directory from the Python
`lib/site-packages` directory. You may also want to remove the Trac `cgi-bin`,
`htdocs` and `templates` directories that are commonly found in a directory
called `share/trac` (the exact location depends on your platform).

2. Upgrade the Trac Environment

Unless noted otherwise, upgrading between major versions (such as 0.8 and
0.9) involves changes to the database schema, and possibly the layout of the
environment. Fortunately, Trac provides automated upgrade scripts to ease the
pain. These scripts are run via `trac-admin`:

   trac-admin /path/to/projenv upgrade

This command will do nothing if the environment is already up-to-date.

3. Update the Trac Documentation

Every Trac environment includes a copy of the Trac documentation for the
installed version. As you probably want to keep the included documentation in
sync with the installed version of Trac, `trac-admin` provides a command to
upgrade the documentation:

   trac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki upgrade

Note that this procedure will of course leave your `WikiStart` page intact.

4. Restart the Web Server

In order to reload the new Trac code you will need to restart your web
server (note this is not necessary for CGI).


The following sections discuss any extra actions that may need to be taken
to upgrade to specific versions of Trac.


From 0.9.x to 0.10.x
--------------------
Due to some changes in the Wiki syntax, you may notice that certain parts of 
your pages no longer work as expected:

 * Previously, links to images would result in that image being embedded 
   into the page. Since 0.10, links to images remain plain links. If you 
   want to embed an image in the page, use the [[Image]] macro.
 * You can no longer use %20 in wiki links to encode spaces. Instead, you 
   should quote the name containing spaces 
   (for example, use wiki:"My page" instead of wiki:My%20page.) 

Several enhancements have been made to the version control subsystem, in
particular for the support of scoped repositories has been improved. It is
recommended that you perform a "trac-admin resync" operation to take
advantage of these improvements.

Also note that the argument list of the "trac-admin initenv" command has
changed: there's a new argument for determining the type of version
control system. The old usage was:

   initenv <projectname> <db> <repospath> <templatepath>

The new usage is:

   initenv <projectname> <db> <repostype> <repospath> <templatepath>

If you're using any scripts that automate the creation of Trac environments,
you will need to update them. If you're using Subversion, specify "svn" for
the <repostype> argument.


From 0.9.3 to 0.9.4
-------------------
There is a bug in Pysqlite 1.x that causes reports using the "%" character 
for LIKE clauses or date formatting to fail. You will need to use escape the 
percent characters with another: "%%".


From 0.9.x to 0.9.3
-------------------
If you are using plugins you might need to upgrade them. See 
http://trac.edgewall.org/milestone/0.9.3 for further details. 


From 0.9-beta to 0.9
--------------------
If inclusion of the static resources (style sheets, javascript, images) is not
working, check the value of the `htdocs_location` in trac.ini. For mod_python,
Tracd and FastCGI, you can simply remove the option altogether. For CGI, you
should fix it to point to the URL you mapped the Trac `htdocs` directory to.

If you've been using plugins with a beta release of Trac 0.9, or have 
disabled some of the built-in components, you might have to update the rules
for disabling/enabling components in trac.ini. In particular, globally 
installed plugins now need to be enabled explicitly. See the TracPlugins and 
TracIni wiki pages for more information.

If you want to enable the display of all ticket changes in the timeline (the
Ticket Details option), you now have to explicitly enable that in trac.ini,
too:

   [timeline]
   ticket_show_details = true


From 0.8.x to 0.9
-----------------
mod_python users will need to change the name of the mod_python handler in
the Apache HTTPD configuration:

   from: PythonHandler trac.ModPythonHandler
   to:   PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend

If you have PySQLite 2.x installed, Trac will now try to open your SQLite
database using the SQLite 3.x file format. The database formats used by
SQLite 2.8.x and SQLite 3.x are incompatible. If you get an error like "file
is encrypted or is not a database" after upgrading, then you must convert
your database file.

To do this, you need to have both SQLite 2.8.x and SQLite 3.x installed (they
have different filenames so can coexist on the same system). Then use the
following commands:

   mv trac.db trac2.db
   sqlite trac2.db .dump | sqlite3 trac.db

After testing that the conversion was successful, the `trac2.db` file can be
deleted. For more information on the SQLite upgrade see
http://www.sqlite.org/version3.html.


From 0.7.x to 0.8
-----------------
0.8 adds a new roadmap feature which requires additional permissions. While a
fresh installation will by default grant `ROADMAP_VIEW` and `MILESTONE_VIEW`
permissions to anonymous, these permissions have to be granted manually when
upgrading:

   trac-admin /path/to/projectenv permission add anonymous MILESTONE_VIEW
   trac-admin /path/to/projectenv permission add anonymous ROADMAP_VIEW


From 0.6.x to 0.7
-----------------
Trac 0.7 introduced a new database format, requiring manual upgrade.

Previous versions of Trac stored wiki pages, ticket, reports, settings,
etc. in a single SQLite database file. Trac 0.7 replaces this file
with a new backend storage format; the 'Trac Environment', which is a
directory containing an SQLite database, a human-readable configuration file,
log-files and attachments.

Fear not though, old-style Trac databases can easily be converted to
Environments using the included `tracdb2env` program as follows:

   tracdb2env /path/to/old/project.db /path/to/new/projectenv

`tracdb2env` will create a new environment and copy the information from the
old database to the new environment. The existing database will not be
modified.

You also need to update your apache configuration:

Change the line:

   SetEnv TRAC_DB "/path/to/old/project.db"

to:

   SetEnv TRAC_ENV "/path/to/new/projectenv"
